Cal Project

What we need to know?
Leap years
Number of days in a month
Text justification
What day of the week the 1st falls on (use Zeller's Congruence)
There are exceptions for every 4th, 100th, and 400th years

0. Create Git repo

1. Start with Integration tests (test complete output)
ex. assert_equal('cal 2 2012', ruby cal.rb 2 2012)

2. Submit link to integration tests to Canvas

3. Implement one method with tests

4. Commit and submit link to Canvas

Sample methods:

print days_of_week
print first_day_of_week (use Zeller's Congruence)
print format_month (date spacing)
